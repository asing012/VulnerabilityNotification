An attacker with the ability to transmit specially-crafted IP traffic to a mobility controller could exploit this vulnerability and cause a process crash or to execute arbitrary code within the underlying operating system with full system privileges. Such an attack could lead to complete system compromise. The ability to transmit traffic to an IP interface on the mobility controller is required to carry out an attack. The attack leverages the PAPI protocol (UDP port 8211). If the mobility controller is only bridging L2 traffic to an uplink and does not have an IP address that is accessible to the attacker, it cannot be attacked.<br>Reference - https://www.arubanetworks.com/assets/alert/ARUBA-PSA-2019-004.txt, https://x-c3ll.github.io/posts/CVE-2018-7081-RCE-ArubaOS/<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2010-5333<br>Published on - 2019-09-13<br>Summary - The web server in Integard Pro and Home before 2.0.0.9037 and 2.2.x before 2.2.0.9037 has a buffer overflow via a long password in an administration login POST request, leading to arbitrary code execution.<br>Reference - https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework/blob/master/modules/exploits/windows/http/integard_password_bof.rb, https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/14941, https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/15016<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-16289<br>Published on - 2019-09-13<br>Summary - The insert-php (aka Woody ad snippets) plugin before 2.2.8 for WordPress allows authenticated XSS via the winp_item parameter.<br>Reference - https://generaleg0x01.com/2019/09/13/xss-woody/, https://wordpress.org/plugins/insert-php/#developers<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-16288<br>Published on - 2019-09-13<br>Summary - On Tenda N301 wireless routers, a long string in the wifiSSID parameter of a goform/setWifi POST request causes the device to crash.<br>Reference - https://pastebin.com/yu8hPE8w<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-3646<br>Published on - 2019-09-13<br>Summary - DLL Search Order Hijacking vulnerability in Microsoft Windows client in McAfee Total Protection (MTP) Free Antivirus Trial 16.0.R18 and earlier allows local users to execute arbitrary code via execution from a compromised folder placed by an attacker with administrator rights.<br>Reference - http://service.mcafee.com/FAQDocument.aspx?&id=TS102968<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-15031<br>Published on - 2019-09-13<br>Summary - In the Linux kernel through 5.2.14 on the powerpc platform, a local user can read vector registers of other users' processes via an interrupt.
