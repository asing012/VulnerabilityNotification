Usage of the `package` key to rename dependencies in `Cargo.toml` is ignored in Rust 1.25.0 and prior. When Rust 1.25.0 and prior is used Cargo may download the wrong dependency, which could be squatted on crates.io to be a malicious package. This not only affects manifests that you write locally yourself, but also manifests published to crates.io. If you published a crate, for example, that depends on `serde1` to crates.io then users who depend on you may also be vulnerable if they use Rust 1.25.0 and prior. Rust 1.0.0 through Rust 1.25.0 is affected by this advisory because Cargo will ignore the `package` key in manifests. Rust 1.26.0 through Rust 1.30.0 are not affected and typically will emit an error because the `package` key is unstable. Rust 1.31.0 and after are not affected because Cargo understands the `package` key. Users of the affected versions are strongly encouraged to update their compiler to the latest available one. Preventing this issue from happening requires updating your compiler to be either Rust 1.26.0 or newer. There will be no patch issued for Rust versions prior to 1.26.0. Users of Rust 1.19.0 to Rust 1.25.0 can instead apply linked patches to mitigate the issue.<br>Reference - https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html#renaming-dependencies-in-cargotoml, https://gist.github.com/pietroalbini/0d293b24a44babbeb6187e06eebd4992, https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/4953, https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/security/advisories/GHSA-phjm-8x66-qw4r, https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rustlang-security-announcements/rVQ5e3TDnpQ<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-17051<br>Published on - 2019-09-30<br>Summary - Evernote before 7.13 GA on macOS allows code execution because the com.apple.quarantine attribute is not used for attachment files, as demonstrated by a one-click attack involving a drag-and-drop operation on a crafted Terminal file.<br>Reference - https://evernote.com/security/updates#MACOSNOTE-28956, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OG2tKlZX5bg<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>CVE-2019-13124<br>Published on - 2019-09-30<br>Summary - Foxit Reader 9.6.0.25114 and earlier has two unique RecursiveCall bugs involving 3 functions exhausting available stack memory because of Uncontrolled Recursion in the V8 JavaScript engine (issue 2 of 2).<br>Reference - https://www.foxitsoftware.com/support/security-bulletins.php<br>ExploitDB - Not Available<br><br>
