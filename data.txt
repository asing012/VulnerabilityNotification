By leveraging multiple components in the Alfresco Software applications, an exploit chain was observed that allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution on the victim machine. The attacker must upload malicious Solr configuration files and then receive a JMX connection from the victim, and serve a Java object that results in deserialization and code execution.<br>Reference - https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14224-Authenticated%20Remote%20Code%20Execution-Alfresco%20Community<br><br>CVE-2019-14222<br>Published on - 2019-09-05<br>Summary - An issue was discovered in Alfresco Community Edition versions 6.0 and lower. An unauthenticated, remote attacker could authenticate to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface. The vulnerability is due to the presence of a default private key that is present in all default installations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by using the extracted private key and bundling it into a PKCS12. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain information about the target system (e.g., OS type, system file locations, Java version, Solr version, etc.) as well as the ability to launch further attacks by leveraging the access to Alfresco's Solr Web Admin Interface.<br>Reference - https://github.com/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/tree/master/CVE-2019-14222-Default%20Certificate-Alfresco%20Community<br><br>CVE-2019-15029<br>Published on - 2019-09-05<br>Summary - FusionPBX 4.4.8 allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands by submitting a malicious command to the service_edit.php file (which will insert the malicious command into the database).

If the build occurred over an insecure connection, a malicious user could have perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack during the build and alter the build artifacts that were produced. In case that any of these artifacts were compromised, any developers using these could be altered. **Note:** In order to validate that this artifact was not compromised, the maintainer would need to confirm that none of the artifacts published to the registry were not altered with. Until this happens, we can not guarantee that this artifact was not compromised even though the probability that this happened is low.<br>Reference - https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JAVA-COMDIFFPLUGSPOTLESS-460377<br><br>CVE-2019-13191<br>Published on - 2019-09-05<br>Summary - A SQL injection vulnerability in IntraMaps MapControl 8 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via the /ApplicationEngine/Search/Refine/Set page.<br>Reference - https://blog.contentsecurity.com.au/mapcontrol-sql-injection<br><br>CVE-2019-15955<br>Published on - 2019-09-05<br>Summary - An issue was discovered in Total.js CMS 12.0.0.
